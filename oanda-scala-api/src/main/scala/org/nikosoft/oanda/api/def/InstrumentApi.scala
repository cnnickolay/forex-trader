    * @param granularity       The granularity of the candlesticks to fetch [default=S5]
    * @param count             The number of candlesticks to return in the reponse. Count should not be specified if both the start and end parameters are provided, as the time range combined with the graularity will determine the number of candlesticks to return. [default=500, maximum=5000]
    * @param from              The start of the time range to fetch candlesticks for.
    * @param to                The end of the time range to fetch candlesticks for.
    * @param smooth            A flag that controls whether the candlestick is “smoothed” or not. A smoothed candlestick uses the previous candle’s close price as its open price, while an unsmoothed candlestick uses the first price from its time range as its open price. [default=False]
    * @param includeFirst      A flag that controls whether the candlestick that is covered by the from time should be included in the results. This flag enables clients to use the timestamp of the last completed candlestick received to poll for future candlesticks but avoid receiving the previous candlestick repeatedly. [default=True]
    * @param dailyAlignment    The hour of the day (in the specified timezone) to use for granularities that have daily alignments. [default=17, minimum=0, maximum=23]
    * @param alignmentTimezone The timezone to use for the dailyAlignment parameter. Candlesticks with daily alignment will be aligned to the dailyAlignment hour within the alignmentTimezone. [default=America/New_York]
    * @param weeklyAlignment   The day of the week used for granularities that have weekly alignment. [default=Friday]
    * @return Fetch candlestick data for an instrument.
